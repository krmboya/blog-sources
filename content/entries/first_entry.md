Description: Announcing the new blog!

The excuse I've been giving to not start blogging has been that I wanted to use 
my own blogging software. I first did a database-backed blog, until I learnt 
that the cool thing nowadays static site generated sites.

Anyway, I have no excuses now, let's see how this blogging thing will go.

You can check out the Python script that generates this blog 
[here](https://github.com/krmboya/ssitegen).

PS: I realized today is the last day of April. So I'm launching this before the 
new month. Completely unintentional!!
