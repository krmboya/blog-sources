Here's the [thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11939851)

How can I describe the feeling while reading through the responses? Almost like 
simultaneously traveling to the past and future of computing..

Something that stood out was his insistence that objects, as he initially 
envisioned them, were still not really understood, despite the pervasiveness of 
'object-oriented' programming.

Also was the idea that we may need to discard most of the foundations we take 
for granted nowadays, in order to make real progress in computing and really 
focus on addressing the problem of scale. (e.g. how can communicating objects 
scale from, say, components in a handheld device, to something like an 
intergalactic system)

Another interesting idea was how, looking at message passing, bundling a message
together with its interpretter, would yield simpler systems.

Anyway, I bet the work he and his research group have been doing contain an 
awful lot of useful ideas.
