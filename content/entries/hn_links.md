Description: Some hacker news convenience links

I sometimes nowadays find myself going days without checking 
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) so I sometimes need to
check what's been hot and trending these past few days :-D

I've decided to post the links I use here so that I don't have to manually
type them or have to bookmark them in whatever device I happen to be using.
