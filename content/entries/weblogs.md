In the spirit of my previous post on 
[hacker news links](http://www.99nth.com/~krm/blog/hn_links.html) I decided to
collect some blogs I like to check back regularly here.

In no particular order..

[Julia Evans](http://jvns.ca/) - A programmer/hacker

[Michael O. Church](https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/) - Interesting views 
on startups, technology workers, economy etc

[Philip Guo (pgbovine)](http://www.pgbovine.net/) - An 
academic/programmer/hacker. Also some interesting geek culture stuff

[Joe Armstrong](https://joearms.github.io/) - Erlang inventor

Some more here as I recall/discover them..
