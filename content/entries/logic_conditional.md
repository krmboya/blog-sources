Description: A small dose of logic..

![A philosopher thinking](static/img/introspection.jpg)

Let's say that the statement **if P then Q** is true.

*P* is sufficient for *Q*

*Q* is necessary for *P*

*P* - It is raining

*Q* - I'll carry an umbrella

*P -> Q* - If it is raining, I'll carry an umbrella

For the statement to be true, it raining is sufficient for me to carry an umbrella.

For the statement to be true, me carrying an umbrella is necessary if it rains.
