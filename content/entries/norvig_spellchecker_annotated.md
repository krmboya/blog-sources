Description: I've always had it in mind to go through this article..

I've always had it in mind to go through 
[this article](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) where 
[Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/) (AI/Google) demonstrates how to write a 
spelling corrector in Python.

In the process, I wrote an annotated version 
[here](https://github.com/krmboya/py-examples/blob/master/spellchecker.py).

In the article itself Norvig describes his process, starting from 
[Bayes' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem) and breaking it
down from there.

The relevant files if you want to try it out are the 
[code](https://github.com/krmboya/py-examples/blob/master/spellchecker.py)
and the
[dictionary](https://github.com/krmboya/py-examples/blob/master/big.txt).

You can also get them from the original article.
